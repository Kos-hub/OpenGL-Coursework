# OpenGL-Coursework

I was asked to create a scene with everything I've learned in my Computer Graphics Module and some extra stuff that I've learned with extra reading.
My scene has geometry and meshes, with textures and phong shading. Along with this, I have shadows and three post processing effects which are grain, greyscale and a contrast.
All these post processing effects (except for greyscale) are extra reading.
Finally, I have a small fire that always faces the camera thanks to a billboarding effect and that is done with particle calculations and buffers. Also this was part of my extra reading.
