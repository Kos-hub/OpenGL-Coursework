# OpenGL-Coursework

I was asked to create a scene with everything I've learned in my Computer Graphics Module and some extra stuff that I've learned with extra reading. < br/>
My scene has geometry and meshes, with textures and phong shading. Along with this, I have shadows and three post processing effects which are grain, greyscale and a contrast.
All these post processing effects (except for greyscale) are extra reading. <br/>
Finally, I have a small fire that always faces the camera thanks to a billboarding effect and the fire itself is done with particle calculations and buffers. This was also part of my extra reading.
